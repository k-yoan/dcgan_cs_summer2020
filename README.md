# Generative Adversarial Networks to solve Compressed Sensing problems
Undergraduate research project (summer 2020)

The initial aim of this research project was to better understand how generative models could be used in the context of compressed sensing. The goal of compressed sensing is to solve an underdetermined system of linear measurements to recover a signal $x$, i.e. we wish to solve $y=Ax+b$. Can generative models (more specifically, GANs) be used to generate that signal?
